# Customer Churn Prediction 🚀

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn prediction is a **Machine Learning** project aimed at identifying customers who are likely to stop using a service. By analyzing past customer data, we can take proactive measures to retain them.

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset used is from **KAGGLE Customer Churn**.
- It contains features such as:
  - **Age**, **Gender**, **Tenure**, **Usage Frequency**, **Support Calls**, **Payment Delay**, **Subscription Type**, **Contract Length**, **Total Spend**, **Last Interaction**, and **Churn** (target variable).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data Processing)
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- **Scikit-learn, XGBoost** (Model Training)
- **Flask** (Deployment)
- **GitHub** (Version Control)

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Handled missing values
- Visualized feature distributions
- Checked class imbalance in **Churn** column

## 🏆 Model Training
Trained different models:
1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Random Forest Classifier**
   

✔️ Achieved **99% accuracy** on test data.

## 📊 Model Evaluation
Used:
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score**
- **ROC-AUC Curve**
